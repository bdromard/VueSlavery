# VueSlavery
Project dedicated to my PhD research, on slavery in first millennium BCE Babylonia.
<br>Made with NodeJS, Express and Sequelize on the back-end, Vue.js and Tailwind on the front-end.

<h2>Setting up the project</h2>
This is a work in progress, with only mostly the backend developed so far. 
<br>If you wish to see how it has been set up so far, you can do the following :
<ul>
  <li>You will need to have <a href='https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/'>Docker installed</a> on your computer.</li>
  <li><code>git clone</code> the project.</li>
  <li><code>docker compose up</code> at the root of the directory.</li>
</ul>
