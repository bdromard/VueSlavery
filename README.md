# VueSlavery
Project dedicated to my PhD research, on slavery in first millennium BCE Babylonia.
<br>Made with NodeJS, Express and Sequelize on the back-end, Vue.js and Tailwind on the front-end.

<h2>Setting up the project</h2>
This is a work in progress, with only mostly the backend developed so far. If you wish to see how it has been set up so far, you can `git clone` the project and type `docker compose up`.
